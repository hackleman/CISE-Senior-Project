# CISE-Project
VR Interface for a NURBS Unity Integration

## Usage
1.  Settings should be configured to be able to test without configuration.
2.  To quickly playtest, open up the "Demo" Scene and Play from there.

### Controls

1.  Interact with control points by using your XR controller's "Activate" control button.  On Oculus devices this is the primary L / R triggers.

2.  Left Ctrl will show / hide control points.  This helps with visibility of the deformed mesh.

3.  Left thumbstick for player movement.
